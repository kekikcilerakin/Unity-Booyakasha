EXT. THE PEN'S GATES - DAY

Alex strolls out the prison gates, lookin' kinda dusty in some old threads. He's gazin' around, all bugged out, like he ain't seen the sun in a minute. He pulls out this big ol' cell phone from his pocket (one of them brick joints from back in the day). His hands are shakin' a little as he punches in some numbers.

(PHONE RINGING)

The phone picks up. You hear this voice on the other end, sounds familiar, ya know? (Could be his moms or his pops).

FAMILY MEMBER (ON PHONE) Yo?

Alex gets ready to speak, his voice kinda rough.

ALEX (All choked up) It's me...

The phone just clicks off, goes dead. Alex is standin' there, holdin' the phone, lookin' all messed up and like his heart just dropped.
