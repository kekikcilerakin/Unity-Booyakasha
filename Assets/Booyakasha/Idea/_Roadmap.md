## TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Unity-Specific Implementations
- Use **NavMesh** and **NavMeshAgents** for NPC navigation
- Leverage **Cinemachine** for camera management
- Implement **Addressable Assets** for efficient content loading
- Use **Shader Graph** for visual effects (gang territory visualization, etc.)
- Consider **ECS/DOTS** for handling large numbers of NPCs efficiently

### Key Technical Challenges
- **AI Performance**: Use object pooling and LOD for NPC behaviors
- **Open World**: Implement streaming of environment chunks
