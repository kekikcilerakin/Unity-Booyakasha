# SCENE 3: SNEAKIN' INTO GOLD TOOTH - NIGHT
## ENGLISH DIALOGUE - GAMEPLAY FOCUSED

### EXT. GOLD TOOTH PAWN - NIGHT

The ride pulls up in front of a dimly lit pawnshop. A flickering neon sign reads: "GOLD TOOTH PAWN". The street's pretty dead.

**ALEX**  
*(After parkin' the ride)*  
Aight, this the spot. Maria, you hold it down out here, keep ya eyes open. Carlos, you roll with me.

**MARIA**  
*(Without gettin' out)*  
Be careful, ya hear?

Alex and Carlos hop out and head towards the front of the pawnshop.

## PLAYER CONTROL BEGINS

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Use [Movement Keys] (e.g., WASD or left analog stick) to move Alex. Press [Interact Key] (e.g., E or X) to interact.

Alex reaches the pawnshop's front door. It's locked tight.

**ALEX**  
*(To himself)*  
Damn. Shoulda known.

Carlos walks up beside Alex.

**CARLOS**  
What's the deal?

**ALEX**  
Door's locked, homie.

Carlos glances around.

**CARLOS**  
Yo, check the side. Might be another way in.

Carlos gestures towards the side of the pawnshop.

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Follow Carlos to the back of the pawnshop.

Alex and Carlos walk around to the back. A rusty metal door is visible, lit by a dim security light.

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Move towards the back door and interact with it.

Alex reaches the back door. It's also locked, but the lock looks older and more worn than the front door's.

**ALEX**  
*(Whispering)*  
This look janky as hell. We could pop this open.

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Press [Interact Key] again at the back door. This will initiate a mini-game to pick the lock. Follow the on-screen instructions to attempt to unlock it.

*Lockpicking Mini-Game: A simple lock and tumblers are shown on screen. The player needs to press the correct keys (e.g., A, S, D) in sequence or move the mouse in a specific way to align the tumblers. Success unlocks the door.*

The player successfully picks the lock, and the door creaks open slightly. A faint light spills out from inside.

**ALEX**  
*(Whispering)*  
Aight, that’s what’s up. Keep it tight, stay low.

**CARLOS**  
*(Nervously)*  
Gotcha.

Alex and Carlos carefully slip inside.

### INT. PAWNSHOP - NIGHT

The interior is dim and dusty. Shelves are crammed with antiques, electronics, jewelry, and all sorts of random junk. A faint smell of mildew hangs in the air.

**ALEX**  
*(Whispering)*  
Alright, this place a damn mess. You remember what Pops wanted?

**CARLOS**  
*(Lookin' around)*  
Yeah… some old pocket watch... couple rare coins… prolly in a safe or some shit.

**ALEX**  
Man, where the hell they keep a safe in a place like this?

## PLAYER CONTROL CONTINUES

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Move Alex around the pawnshop. Look for interactive points (e.g., shelves, counter, doors).

The player navigates Alex through the cluttered pawnshop. After checkin' a few shelves, Alex spots a closed door behind the counter.

**ALEX** 
Yo, check that. Might be somethin' back there.

**CARLOS**
This ain't no regular lock… Looks like it’s hooked to an alarm or somethin’.

**ALEX**
Yeah, nah. We ain't tryna trip nothin'. Keep lookin’.

The player continues to search the pawnshop more thoroughly. After a while, towards the back, Alex notices an old pocket watch and some antique coins inside a locked glass display case. The items match their father's description.

**ALEX**  
Carlos, I think we found it! Check out the watch and the coins. Looks like what Pops was talkin' 'bout.

Alex approaches the display case and presses the interact button. The case is locked.

**CARLOS**  
*(Disappointed)*  
Aw, man. Locked up too.

**ALEX**  
Alright, chill. Gotta be a key somewhere around here. Maybe on the counter.

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Head back to the counter and search for the key. Interact with objects on and around the counter.

The player searches the counter and its drawers, eventually finding a small key.

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Use the key to unlock the display case.

The player uses the key to unlock the display case.

Just then, a loud crash comes from the front of the shop – somethin' definitely broke!

**ALEX**  
*(Panicked)*  
What the...? What was that?

**CARLOS**  
I don't know, homie. But we gotta go, now! Take this shit and get outta here.

Alex pockets the watch and coins.

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Head back to the rear door and exit.

Alex and Carlos quickly move towards the back door.
