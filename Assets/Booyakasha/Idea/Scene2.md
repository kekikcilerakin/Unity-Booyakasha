SAHNE 2: YOLCULUK - GECE (DÄ°YALOG)

MARIA You think Pops was serious back there, Alex? About kickin' you out the fam and all that?

ALEX Chill out, Maria. He just tryin' to get us motivated, know what I'm sayin'? We gonna handle this, no sweat.

CARLOS But he didn't sound like he was playin', homie. For real though... What if we choke?

ALEX Cut that noise, Carlos. We ain't got no choice. We gotta make this happen. Besides, we ain't gonna fail. We rollin' with the best.
