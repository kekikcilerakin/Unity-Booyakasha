**SCENE 4: THE HEAT IS ON - NIGHT (REVISED DIALOGUE - ENGLISH SLANG)**

**EXT. GOLD TOOTH PAWN BACK & CITY STREETS - NIGHT**

Alex and Carlos burst out the back door. Just then, the wail of sirens starts up from the front.

**CARLOS**
(Panicked)
Ah, shit—THE FEDS!

**ALEX**
(Lookin' around)
We gotta MOVE. Where the hell is Maria?!

More sirens blare from the front, and blue and red lights start flashin' down the street.

**ALEX**
(Yellin')
Maria! Get the fuck over here, NOW!

Maria pulls up in the ride towards the back of the pawnshop.

**MARIA**
(Worried)
What the hell y’all do?! How they get here so damn fast?!

**ALEX**
(Runnin' towards the car)
No clue, just DRIVE!

Alex and Carlos jump into the back seat. Maria floors it, and the car speeds away.

**(PLAYER CONTROL BEGINS - MARIA)**

**PLAYER INSTRUCTION:** Use [Driving Controls] to drive the car as Maria. Try to evade the pursuing police vehicles. Follow the route to the safe house marked on the map.

**ALEX**
(Yellin' from the back)
Maria, mash that pedal! These cops are on our tail!

**MARIA**
(Panicked)
I'm tryin', fool! This whip ain't nothin' but a bucket!

Maria whips through alleys and streets, tryin' to shake the police. The sirens get closer and further away. The player maneuvers through tight spots and dodges other cars, tryin' to lose the heat.

**ALEX**
Yo, how the fuck they know we was in there?! Somebody snitch?!

**MARIA**
Nah, man. Ain't nobody see us. Somethin' must've tripped inside.

**CARLOS**
Or maybe some nosy-ass old lady peeped my ride and called the five-O!

👮‍♂️ (Over radio, distorted)
PULL OVER NOW!

After a few minutes of chasin', Maria makes a wrong turn, and the car rolls into a cul-de-sac. A high wall or gate blocks the end of the street, and there ain't enough room to turn around.

**ALEX**
(Looking ahead, realizing something BAD)
Shit, Maria—don’t take this left—!

**MARIA**
(Confused, turning wheel hard)
What?!

🚧 High brick walls. No exits. 🚧

🚔 The cop cars slide in behind them, blocking the only way out.

**MARIA**
(Slamming the wheel, eyes wide with panic)
FUCK. We boxed in!

🚔🚔🚔 Cops spill out of their vehicles, guns drawn.

🔊 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (V.O.)
“Step out of the vehicle with your hands up!”

🚓🚨 Flashlights blind them.

Alex, Carlos, and Maria sit frozen, breathing heavy. Trapped. No way out.
